##  Application Walkthrough

This walkthrough provides a step-by-step overview of how the application works and what each part does visually and functionally.

### üñºÔ∏è Interface Overview

The application window is divided into two main areas:
- **Canvas (Center Pane):** Where nodes and edges are visually placed and connected.
- **Control Panel (Right Side):** Contains all interactive buttons and options for the user.

---

### üü® Step-by-Step Flow

#### 1. **Start with Adding Nodes**
- Click `Add Node`, then click on the canvas.
- A circular node appears with a label (e.g., N1).
- Repeat to add more nodes.

#### 2. **Connect Nodes via Edges**
- Click on two nodes one after the other.
- A prompt asks for the **weight** of the edge (e.g., `5.0`).
- An edge is drawn and the weight is shown in yellow between the nodes.

#### 3. **Choose Routing Metric**
- Choose either:
  - `Hop Count (AODV)` for fewer hops.
  - `Weighted Path` to consider edge weights.
- This affects the simulation route.

#### 4. **Select Source and Destination**
- Click `Select Route`, then click two nodes:
  - First: Source Node
  - Second: Destination Node

#### 5. **Run the Simulation**
- Click `Run AODV`.
- A red circle (packet) animates from the source to the destination.
- The shortest path is drawn in **green dashed lines**.
- The Simulation Log Table records every step (time, event, details).

#### 6. **Clear the Path**
- Click `Clear Path` to remove the current route and packet animation.

#### 7. **Remove Node**
- Click `Remove Node`, then select a node on the canvas.
- The selected node and all its connected edges and weights are removed.

### üßæ Simulation Log Table
- Located at the bottom of the control panel.
- Shows:
  - **Time** of event
  - **Type** of event (e.g., Add, Delete, Route)
  - **Details** (e.g., source, destination, weight)

This helps track all actions and understand how the routing simulation progressed.

##  Algorithms Implemented

This simulation application supports routing algorithms tailored for network pathfinding, especially in dynamic and weighted topologies.

### 1. **AODV (Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) Routing**

AODV is a reactive routing protocol used in wireless ad hoc networks. The application simulates its simplified behavior with the following key features:

- **Route Discovery on Demand:**
  - Routes are discovered only when needed (i.e., when you click "Select Route").
  - Simulates RREQ (Route Request) and RREP (Route Reply) messages.

- **Hop Count Metric:**
  - Uses the number of hops (edges) between source and destination as the primary metric for routing.

- **No Routing Tables:**
  - In this simulation, route states are not cached. The shortest path is recalculated each time.

---

### 2. **Weighted Shortest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm)**

When the user selects the **"Weighted Path"** option:

- **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm** is used to find the path with the **minimum total edge weight**.
- Edge weights are manually entered by the user during edge creation.
- The path calculation considers the cost rather than just the number of hops.

---

### Routing Metric Toggle

The application provides a **toggle switch** between:
- **Hop Count** (Unweighted shortest path ‚Äì classic AODV style)
- **Weighted Path** (Dijkstra's Algorithm ‚Äì used in real-world weighted networks)

---

### Visualization
- Paths are visualized in real-time using animated red "packet" movements.
- Route discovery and traversal are logged step-by-step in the simulation log.


##  Simulation Metrics

The simulation provides real-time metrics and visual feedback to help users analyze and understand the behavior of the routing algorithms. The following metrics and data are displayed or logged during the simulation:

### 1. **Routing Metric Selection**
- **Hop Count**: Measures the number of nodes (hops) between source and destination.
- **Weighted Path**: Calculates the total weight of the edges along the path.

> Users can toggle between these metrics using the radio buttons provided in the UI.

---

### 2. **Simulation Log**
A structured table displays:
- üïí **Time**: Timestamp of the event.
- üß© **Event Type**: Such as Node Added, Route Selected, or Simulation Started.
- üìã **Details**: Specific details related to each event (e.g., path discovered, weight values, failure messages).

---

### 3. **Visual Indicators**
- **Route Lines**: Displayed in green dashes to highlight the final chosen route.
- **Packet Animation**: A red dot travels across the path to simulate packet transmission.
- **Edge Weights**: Clearly labeled on the graph to assist in visual path comparison.

---

### 4. **Node and Edge Tracking**
- Every node and edge creation, update, or removal is logged and visually represented.
- Edge weights can be edited, and changes are reflected both visually and in path calculations.

---

### 5. **Performance Feedback**
- Pathfinding response is near-instantaneous.
- Logs indicate success or failure in route discovery.

These metrics provide an educational and interactive experience, especially useful for learning about network routing protocols and graph algorithms.


##  Testing and Validation

Robust testing and validation were carried out to ensure the accuracy, stability, and usability of the routing simulation tool. Various aspects of the application were examined through manual and functional testing.

---

### 1. **Functionality Testing**

- ‚úÖ Simulation of shortest path using both hop count and weighted metrics.
- ‚úÖ Toggle between different routing algorithms without breaking functionality.
- ‚úÖ Node and edge deletion with proper visual and data model updates.

---

### 2. **Pathfinding Accuracy**
- Simulated various network topologies to verify that:
  - The AODV algorithm correctly finds the shortest path based on the selected metric.
  - The weighted path simulation considers real-time updated weights.
- Compared output paths against manually calculated expected results.

---

### 3. **UI Responsiveness**
- Verified seamless user interaction for:
  - Button clicks and their corresponding actions.
  - Dynamic updates in the graph pane (like animation and routing lines).
  - Real-time logging in the simulation table.

---

### 4. **Edge Case Handling**
Tested scenarios included:
- Attempting to create duplicate nodes or edges.
- Selecting the same node as both source and destination.
- Running simulations without selecting a route.
- Removing nodes involved in active routes.

---

### 5. **Error Feedback and Logging**
- Implemented structured and time-stamped logs to capture every interaction and simulation event.
- Errors (e.g., invalid weights, unreachable destinations) are gracefully handled and clearly reported.

---

### 6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- Confirmed smooth execution on multiple systems using Java 21 and JavaFX 21.
- Tested with Gradle to ensure reliable building and launching on both Windows and Linux environments.

> **Outcome**: All features passed the test scenarios successfully, confirming the system‚Äôs correctness and user-friendliness.
